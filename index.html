        <p>
          <strong>Bow &amp; Crescent</strong> is a tax advisory firm serving an
          international clientele at the intersection of private equity, venture
          capital, and digital assets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our founder has spent over two decades working at the investor and
          venture capital level &mdash; first in Big Four public accounting, then
          embedded within leading digital asset VC funds. That firsthand experience
          on the investment side means we understand tax not as an abstract
          compliance exercise, but as a core component of fund strategy and
          portfolio value creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          We specialize in the tax challenges unique to fund managers, LPs, and
          portfolio companies operating across US and international jurisdictions &mdash;
          as well as the broader digital asset tax landscape, from token economics
          and DeFi protocols to on-chain reporting and evolving regulatory frameworks.
